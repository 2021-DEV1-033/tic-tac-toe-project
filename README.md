The back end takes into consideration the possibility of having parts with dimensions greater than 3x3.

It is for this reason, and also to guarantee a better performance, the position analysis is done for the boxes closest to the last box selected by a player.
.

Also to give a better scalability, I persist the data of all the played games to give a possibility of adding functionality like remote players with an authentication or public room creation
